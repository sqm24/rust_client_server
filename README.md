This is my implementation of a client server architecture in Rust.

Threaded and Async

Server is running...
Waiting....

Client1 connects to server...
Server spawns thread for Client1 which will allow them to communicate back and forth...
Client1 enters their information which is stored on the server side

Server waits for second player...

Client2 connects to server...
Server spawns thread for Client2 which will allow them to communicate back and forth...
Client2 enters their information which is stored on the server side

Server connects Client1 and Client2 to each other as part of a Game struct.

The game struct will say whos turn it is so they don't override each other.

C1 makes move. Move -> Server. Server updates board. Server sends updates to both C1 and C2 so the board is now complete.
